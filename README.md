🚀 Space Missions EDA Project

This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of 4,630+ global space missions conducted by various countries and organizations from the 1950s to 2020.
It is my first complete end-to-end data analysis project, completed in 7 days (~4–5 hrs/day).

The goal was to clean the raw dataset, engineer meaningful features, explore trends, and uncover insights about mission success rates, rocket usage, costs, countries, and technological progress.

📂 What This Project Includes

Full data cleaning & preprocessing

Feature engineering (Country, Year, Month, Decade, etc.)

20+ visualizations (bar charts, pie charts, line plots, heatmap, scatterplots, histogram)

Insights about:

Success vs failure patterns

Rocket usage statistics

Cost analysis

Yearly & decade-wise trends

Country-wise performance

Rocket lifespan

And much more

💡 Highlights (Short Summary)

USA & Russia dominate global rocket launches

Cosmos-3M is the most used rocket with a 93.9% success rate

December has the highest number of launches; January the lowest

Success rates increased sharply over the decades

Arianespace has the highest average mission cost

SpaceX average mission price was analyzed separately

160+ rockets last only 0–1 years

Majority of rockets (~3600) are retired
