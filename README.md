# 🚀 Space Missions EDA Project
This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of 4,630+ global space missions conducted by various countries and organizations from the 1950s to 2020.
It is my first complete end-to-end data analysis project, completed in 7 days (~4–5 hrs/day).

The goal was to clean the raw dataset, engineer meaningful features, explore trends, and uncover insights about mission success rates, rocket usage, costs, countries, and technological progress.

### 📂 What This Project Includes
- Full data cleaning & preprocessing
- Feature engineering (Country, Year, Month, Decade, etc.)
- 15+ visualizations (bar charts, pie charts, line plots, heatmap, scatterplots, histogram)
- Insights about:
- Success vs failure patterns
- Rocket usage statistics
- Cost analysis
- Yearly & decade-wise trends
- Country-wise performance
- Rocket lifespan
And much more

### 💡 Highlights (Short Summary)
1. USA & Russia dominate global rocket launches
2. Cosmos-3M is the most used rocket with a 93.9% success rate
3. December has the highest number of launches; January the lowest
4. Success rates increased sharply over the decades
5. Arianespace has the highest average mission cost
6. SpaceX average mission price was analyzed separately
7. 160+ rockets last only 0–1 years
8. Majority of rockets (~3600) are retired
